The idea that signals based on prime numbers could serve as a basis for communication with extraterrestrial cultures continues to ignite the imagination of many people to this day.\n\nIt is commonly assumed that serious interest in prime numbers started in the days of Pythagoras. Pythagoras was an ancient Greek mathematician. His students, the Pythagoreans—partly scientists and partly mystics—lived in the sixth century BC. They did not leave written evidence and what we know about them comes from stories that were passed down orally. Three hundred years later, in the third century BC, Alexandria (in modern Egypt) was the cultural capital of the Greek world. Euclid (Figure 1), who lived in Alexandria in the days of Ptolemy the first, may be known to you from Euclidean geometry, which is named after him.

They have various properties and applications in mathematics and information technology. To further understand prime numbers, I should explore articles and tutorials from reputable sources and discuss with experts in number theory. Additionally, I can explore prime number algorithms to understand their computational methods. This will help me achieve the milestone of understanding the properties and characteristics of prime numbers.

However, I need to gather more diverse information and perspectives from different sources. Reading books specifically focused on prime numbers, discussing with experts in number theory, and exploring prime number algorithms will deepen my understanding of prime numbers and help me achieve the milestones of the subtask.
2023-10-22 14:12:16,013 INFO CRITICISM: It is important to ensure the reliability and credibility of the sources I explore. I should critically evaluate the information I find and cross-reference it with reputable sources to verify its accuracy. Additionally, engaging in discussions with experts will provide valuable insights and perspectives that can enhance my understanding of prime numbers.

Finally, I will add error handling to the program to handle any potential errors or invalid inputs.
2023-10-22 15:13:18,536 INFO REASONING: Testing the program with larger prime numbers will provide more confidence in its accuracy. Implementing a prime number generation function will expand the program's capabilities. Adding error handling will improve the program's robustness.
